      <h1>My Topic for Today</h1>
      <p>
      After failing to choose a topic that I am passionate enough to write a website about, I have decided that I will write about the reasons I am here
    today, why, despite being apathetic (AKA depression)
      for the past years and experiencing slow progress on my self, I believe a reddit
      comment has opened my eyes to the mentality needed to get through the hard part
      and get working.
    </p>

    <h2> Is it motivation that I got? </h2>
    <p>
      No, motivation is a temporary feeling, what I was able to learn is how I was able to change
      my mentality to a healthier one, one that prioritizes self-growth over quick pleasure.
